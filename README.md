# My 2D Chess Game
Hello,
I've developed this game for my Object Oriented Programming course in 2012. It was originally in a Google Code (RIP) SVN repo, and I've translated most of (if not all) the code, comments and UI from Brazilian Portuguese to English before posting. 

##Current features (Nov 2016)
- 2 player game (in the same computer) 
- Save game ("Save" in default directory and "Save As..." for a custom directory)
- Load game ("Load" from the default directory and "Load from..." for a custom directory)
- Ability to undo the last move
- Ability to redo the last move (after undone)
- Game clock and play clock
